# Vanilla JS Seed 
## For the simple(ish) things in life üèñ 

### About

**What is this?**\
Just a lame little vanilla Javascript starter

**But why?**\
I'm finicky and decided that the world doesn't have enough custom JS starters (it does). I wanted to mess around with web components, and I needed something simple. 

**Why should I use this?**\
Good question! It's broken and the initial components are horrible, so I wouldn't recommend using it in the near future.

### Installation
**I haven't set up a target repo yet**\
Run ```sh init.sh```, and follow the prompts. After the script runs, head over to [Github's "Create a New Repo" page](https://github.com/new). Enter the same repo name from the script output, and away you will go - the upstream is already set for you :)

**I already set up my target repo**\
Run ```sh existing.sh```. When prompted, enter your existing repo's SSH/HTTPS clone link - your upstream will be set to that new value.

**Okay, I have a target repo**\
Cool cool. Get started with this

```js
yarn install --dev

// Local development
yarn dev 

// Ship it out
yarn prod

// Run it!
node server.js
```
